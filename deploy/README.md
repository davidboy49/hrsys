# Running PeopleDesk on your own VPS

This runs the same app as Vercel, in Docker, on one server: the app, Postgres, private photo storage (MinIO) and Caddy for HTTPS.
Vercel and Neon keep working while you set this up. Treat the VPS as a second copy until you switch over.

Server: Ubuntu 22.04 or 24.04, 2 vCPU, 4 GB RAM, SSD. Singapore is a good place for Cambodian users.

> These files have not been run yet (Docker is not installed on the development PC). Do the first install while Vercel is still live and expect to fix small things.

## 1. Prepare the server

```bash
# as root, or with sudo
apt update && apt upgrade -y
curl -fsSL https://get.docker.com | sh
apt install -y git ufw
ufw allow OpenSSH && ufw allow 80/tcp && ufw allow 443 && ufw --force enable
```

Use SSH keys and turn off password login. Docker publishes only ports 80 and 443; the database and storage are not reachable from outside.

## 2. Domain in Cloudflare

Add a DNS record `hr` (or any name) of type A pointing to the VPS address. Proxy on (orange cloud) is fine.
In Cloudflare SSL/TLS set the mode to **Full (strict)**.

## 3. Get the code and settings

```bash
git clone https://github.com/davidboy49/hrsys.git peopledesk && cd peopledesk
cp deploy/env.example .env
nano .env        # fill in every value; secrets: openssl rand -hex 24
```

`AUTH_SECRET`: if you will copy the data from Vercel, use the same value as on Vercel (so the saved Telegram token still decrypts).

## 4. Start

```bash
docker compose up -d --build
docker compose logs -f app      # wait for "Ready"; migrations run first
```

Open `https://your-domain`. Test with the real domain, not the IP address: the app forces HTTPS.

A brand new install has no users. Create the first admin once:

```bash
docker compose exec -e SEED_ADMIN_EMAIL=you@company.com -e SEED_ADMIN_PASSWORD='choose-a-long-password' app npx tsx prisma/seed.ts
```

Skip this step if you restore the Vercel data (section 5).

## 5. Copy the data from Vercel and Neon

Do this once to test, and again right before you switch, so nothing is lost.

Database (use the **unpooled** Neon URL, run on the VPS or your PC):

```bash
pg_dump "NEON_UNPOOLED_URL" --no-owner --no-acl -Fc -f neon.dump
docker compose cp neon.dump db:/tmp/neon.dump
docker compose exec db pg_restore -U peopledesk -d peopledesk --clean --if-exists --no-owner /tmp/neon.dump
docker compose restart app
```

Photos: employee photos and the logo are the same `s3:<key>` references, so copy the files with the MinIO client:

```bash
# on the VPS, with the Neon bucket details from your .env.local
docker run --rm --network host -it --entrypoint sh minio/mc -c '
  mc alias set neon NEON_ENDPOINT NEON_KEY NEON_SECRET &&
  mc alias set vps http://127.0.0.1:9000 MINIO_USER MINIO_PASSWORD &&
  mc mirror neon/uploads vps/uploads'
```

(MinIO's port is not published by default. For this one copy, add `ports: ["127.0.0.1:9000:9000"]` to the `minio` service, run the command, then remove it.)

## 6. Scheduled job (missing check-out report)

Vercel Cron does not exist here. Add this on the VPS (`crontab -e`). The time is UTC: 11:30 UTC is 18:30 in Phnom Penh.

```
30 11 * * 1-6 curl -fsS -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_CRON_SECRET" https://your-domain/api/cron/missing-checkout >/dev/null
0 19 * * * /home/YOU/peopledesk/deploy/backup.sh >> /var/log/peopledesk-backup.log 2>&1
```

While Vercel is still live, the Vercel cron also runs. Both sending to the same Telegram group means double messages, so switch Telegram off in the copy you are not using.

## 7. Backups

`deploy/backup.sh` writes a database dump and a photos archive to `/var/backups/peopledesk` and keeps 14 days. Copy that folder off the server, for example with `rclone` to Cloudflare R2.

Test a restore once, on a spare database, before you rely on it:

```bash
docker compose exec -T db pg_restore -U peopledesk -d peopledesk --clean --if-exists --no-owner < /var/backups/peopledesk/db-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS.dump
```

## 8. Updating

```bash
./deploy/update.sh
```

This pulls the latest code, rebuilds and restarts. Database migrations run on start.

## 9. Switching over from Vercel

1. Announce a short break outside working hours.
2. Repeat section 5 for a fresh copy of the data.
3. Point your domain at the VPS (or change the staff link and QR codes to the new address).
4. Printed QR codes contain the web address. If the address changes, print new ones.
5. Keep Vercel for a week as a fallback, then remove its cron and Telegram settings.

## Notes

- Visitor addresses: `deploy/Caddyfile` trusts Cloudflare's address list. If you do not use the Cloudflare proxy, nothing breaks, the real address is still used.
- ZKTeco devices that push to `/iclock` use plain HTTP on many models; talk to me before enabling that on the VPS.
- Everything is stored in Docker volumes `pgdata` (database), `miniodata` (photos) and `caddy_data` (certificates).
